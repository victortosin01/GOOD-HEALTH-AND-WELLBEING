# GOOD-HEALTH-AND-WELLBEING

Using clustering and classification techniques, we were able to gain useful insights from the datasets provided. In this project, we have the file that did the exploratory data analysis of the files provided and the other file focuses on the Machine Learning model of the datasets.
